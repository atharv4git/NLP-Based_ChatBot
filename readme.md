The chatbot could use natural language processing to understand user input and generate appropriate responses. Inputs could include text-based user messages. Outputs could include text-based responses from the chatbot.
    
**Problem Statement**: Many businesses and organizations are looking for efficient and cost-effective ways to provide customer support and engage with their customers. Traditional methods, such as phone or email support, can be time-consuming and require dedicated staff to manage. A chatbot program could provide an automated and interactive way for businesses and organizations to communicate with their customers.

**Inputs**: The chatbot program could accept text-based user messages (e.g. “What are your opening hours?” or “How do I return an item?”). The system could also accept information about the business or organization (e.g. opening hours, return policy).

**Outputs**: The chatbot program could provide text-based responses to the user’s messages based on the information provided by the business or organization. The system could also provide feedback to the user (e.g. confirmation of actions taken) to help them complete their tasks.
